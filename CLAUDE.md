## Project Overview

**Meno** helps women navigate perimenopause and menopause with evidence-based information and compassionate support.

**Core Mission:** Your symptoms are real. You don't have to just live with it. Help is available.

**What Meno Is:** Symptom tracking, educational resource, LLM-powered pattern recognition, provider discovery, bridge to informed healthcare conversations.

**What Meno Is NOT:** Not a diagnostic tool. Not a treatment recommendation engine. Not a replacement for medical advice. Not a medication management system (V1).

**Key Constraint:** We NEVER cross the line into medical advice. We provide information and pattern recognition, not diagnosis or treatment recommendations.

## Database Schema

Full schema in `docs/dev/DESIGN.md` Section 9.

**Key tables:** `users`, `symptom_logs`, `symptoms_reference` (34 symptoms, public), `symptom_summary_cache`, `conversations` (JSONB), `providers` (public), `exports` (immutable audit trail), `rag_documents` (vector embeddings)

**Security:** All user-data tables have RLS enabled via `auth.uid()`. Reference tables (`symptoms_reference`, `providers`) have no RLS.

---

## Backend Architecture

**All backend patterns and rules are in `.claude/skills/backend-development/SKILL.md`.** Consult it before writing any backend code.

Layer order: Routes (thin) → Services (logic) → Repositories (data) → Utils (pure functions).
Build order: Models → Repositories → Services → Dependencies → Routes → Tests.

Logging: `ruff` style. Google-style docstrings only when they add info the code doesn't convey. Type hints on all function signatures.

### PII-Safe Logging (CRITICAL)

**Health app logs must NEVER contain personal or medical data.** This includes symptom descriptions, user-generated text, health info, DOB, or plaintext user IDs.

- Log structure and metadata, never content
- Use `app.utils.logging`: `hash_user_id()`, `safe_len()`, `safe_keys()`, `safe_summary()`
- Full guide: `docs/dev/backend/LOGGING.md`

---

## Frontend

**All frontend patterns and rules are in `.claude/skills/frontend-development/SKILL.md`.** Consult it before writing any frontend code.

**Frontend design** All design patterns and colors are in `.claude/skills/meno-design-system/SKILL.md`

SvelteKit 2.x + Svelte 5 runes + TypeScript strict. Mobile-first (375px → 768px → 1024px). WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Tailwind utility classes.

**Svelte 5 Conventions (breaking changes from Svelte 4):** Use `$props()` not `export let`. Use `onclick={}` not `on:click={}`. Use `{@render children()}` not `<slot />`. Import from `$app/state` not `$app/stores`.

---

## Testing

**TDD is non-negotiable for new code.** For every new function, endpoint, or
component: write a failing test FIRST, run it, confirm it fails because the
feature is missing, then write the minimum implementation to make it pass.
If you catch yourself writing implementation before the test, stop — delete
the implementation, write the test, watch it fail, then reimplement. Read
the `testing-discipline` skill in `.claude/skills/` for the full rules.
Consult it before writing any code.

**Backend:** pytest + pytest-asyncio. Test files mirror source structure. Use `tests/fixtures/supabase.py` helpers for Supabase mocking.

**Frontend:** Vitest + @testing-library/svelte for components. Playwright for E2E (V2).

---

## LLM & RAG Strategy

**Division of labor:** Python calculates statistics (deterministic). LLM generates narratives from those stats (meaning-making). Never send raw symptom logs to the LLM — send calculated patterns + cached summary only.

**Anonymization:** Strip all PII before LLM calls. Use relative dates ("Day 1, Day 3"). Send only relevant symptom subsets.

**Prompt architecture (4 layers):** Core identity → Source grounding → Behavioral guardrails → Dynamic context (journey stage, age, cached summary, RAG chunks)

**LLM provider:** OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) for development. Claude for production. Swappable via `LLM_PROVIDER` env var + thin wrapper in `app/services/llm.py`.

**RAG pipeline:**

- Sources: Menopause Wiki (with permission), 75-150 curated PubMed papers (post-2015), Menopause Society + British Menopause Society guidelines
- Embeddings: sentence-transformers (dev) / text-embedding-3-small (prod, 1536 dims)
- Storage: pgvector in Supabase, cosine similarity, top 5 chunks per query
- Chunking: Wiki 500 tokens/50 overlap by section; PubMed by abstract/methods/results/conclusion
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword) in V2

---

## Privacy & Ethics

**Data ownership:** Users own their data. Full export anytime. Account deletion = 30-day soft delete then hard delete. Data never sold or shared.

**Medical advice boundary:**

- ✅ "Research suggests sleep disruption is common during perimenopause"
- ✅ "Your logs show sleep and brain fog co-occurring frequently"
- ✅ "Here are questions to ask your provider about hormone therapy"
- ❌ "You have perimenopause" (diagnosis)
- ❌ "You should take X supplement" (treatment recommendation)
- ❌ "You don't need to see a doctor" (replacing medical advice)

Enforced via system prompts, soft redirects, hard stops for prompt injection, UI disclaimers.

**Security:** Secrets in `.env` only (never committed). RLS on all user tables. HTTPS in production. Backend validates all requests (defense-in-depth with RLS).

---

## Authentication Flow

Supabase Auth: email/password for V1, magic links in V2. Frontend uses `@supabase/supabase-js`. Backend uses service role key. RLS enforces data isolation at DB level.

**Data flow:** User Action → Supabase Client (auth) → FastAPI Endpoint (logic) → Supabase Service (service key) → PostgreSQL (RLS)

---

## Current Phase

**V2 Status:** Appointment prep flow complete. Period tracking complete. Medication tracking in progress.

**Next priorities:** Ensure code meets standards. Increase tests in frontend.

**Deferred to V3:** MCP servers (RAG + provider search), magic link auth, mobile app, map view for providers.

## Compaction Instructions

When compacting, always preserve: the full list of modified files, any test commands that were run, the current feature being implemented, and any errors encountered.

Always consult the skills in .claude/skills/ before writing code.
