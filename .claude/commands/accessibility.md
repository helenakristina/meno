# Accessibility audit

Please audit all pages in my Meno app for accessibility:

- Use Playwright to navigate to each page (Dashboard, Log Symptoms, Ask Meno, Providers, Export)
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Check for ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Analyze color contrast
- Generate a detailed accessibility.md report in docs/dev/

Pages to audit:

- /dashboard
- /log-symptoms
- /ask-meno
- /providers
- /export
